"""Shared helpers for the Playwright E2E smoke suite.

Written against the Python `playwright` package (already present in the `ds`
conda env, browsers pre-cached), matching the umoja-voices/ebc-songs/
merch-mockup/career-transition e2e convention. Run each spec directly, or
all of them via `run.py`:

    conda run -n ds python e2e/run.py
    conda run -n ds python e2e/test_landing_page.py

BASE_URL defaults to local dev; CI overrides it to point at a production
build (`next build && next start`) rather than a dev server.

en-mascaradores is a static marketing page with no accounts, database, or
forms of its own — every request is anonymous, so there's no login/session
caching here.
